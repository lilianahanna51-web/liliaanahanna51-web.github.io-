This project examines how machine-learning models can predict one-year diabetes disease progression using baseline clinical measurements from the scikit-learn Diabetes dataset. By analyzing relationships between variables such as BMI, blood pressure, and serum biomarkers, the study compares the performance of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression to determine which approach provides the most accurate predictions. Through exploratory visualization, model evaluation using Mean Squared Error, and interpretation of feature importance, the project highlights how different modeling techniques capture the underlying patterns in metabolic health and disease progression.
