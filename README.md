This project examines how machine-learning models can predict one-year diabetes disease progression using baseline clinical measurements from the scikit-learn Diabetes dataset. By analyzing relationships between variables such as BMI, blood pressure, and serum biomarkers, the study compares the performance of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression to determine which approach provides the most accurate predictions. Through exploratory visualization, model evaluation using Mean Squared Error, and interpretation of feature importance, the project highlights how different modeling techniques capture the underlying patterns in metabolic health and disease progression.

The report contains:

- Detailed data description and exploratory BMI vs. progression plot  
- Modeling pipeline and assumptions for each method  
- Comparison table of test MSE for all models  
- Random Forest feature-importance visualization  
- Discussion, limitations, and conclusions

## Preprocessed Data

The data used in this project is the **Diabetes dataset** from `sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes`, which provides:

- 442 patients  
- 10 standardized predictors (age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and six serum markers)  
- 1 continuous target: **disease progression after one year**

All predictors are standardized (mean 0, variance 1), making them directly suitable for regularized regression methods such as Lasso and Ridge.
