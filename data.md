# Preprocessed Data

This page describes the dataset and preprocessing steps used in my AOS C204 final project.

### Dataset Description
The project uses the **Diabetes Dataset**, a clinical dataset containing 442 patient samples and 10 standardized predictors.

### Predictors
- Age  
- Sex  
- BMI  
- Blood pressure  
- Serum markers s1–s6  

### Preprocessing Steps
- Standardization (mean 0, variance 1)  
- Train/test split (70/30)  
- Feature inspection  
- Exploratory visualization (BMI vs. progression)

### Raw & Processed Data Files
The scikit-learn diabetes dataset is built-in and not uploaded manually.
